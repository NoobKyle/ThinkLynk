Hey, my name is Kyle - a 16 year old Full-Stack Web Developer.

I have been coding for 2.5+ years now and have made many projects some which were not big enough to be put out to the world and are now collecting dust on my hardrives.

I figured there could be someone out there in the world who could need one of the ideas I would have come up with or just think they are cool and would want to make their own version. So I created this site.

I call it A Home For My Inventions.

These are ideas of creations I would love to build out someday and I can document them here for future referencing.

Take a look around and don't forget to reach out to me on Twitter.
